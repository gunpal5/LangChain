        //// # Getting the chain output
        //// 
        //// Almost every possible link in a chain are having having at least one input and output.
        //// 
        //// Look here:

        var chain =
            Set(prompt, outputKey: "prompt")
            | LLM(model, inputKey: "prompt", outputKey: "result");

        //// This means that, after link `Set` get executed, we are storring it's result into "prompt" variable inside of chain context.
        //// In its turn, link `LLM` gets "prompt" variable from chain context and uses it's as input.
        //// 
        //// `LLM` link also has output key argument. Let's use it to save the result of llm.

        var result = await chain.RunAsync("result", CancellationToken.None);

        //// Now the `LLM` link saves it's result into "result" variable inside of chain context. But how do we extract it from there?
        //// 
        //// `chain.Run()` method has an optional argument "resultKey". This allows you to specify variable inside of chain context to return as a result.

        Console.WriteLine(result);

        //// Output:
        //// ```
        //// Hello, World! How can I help you today?
